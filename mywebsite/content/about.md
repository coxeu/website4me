* I am a  2nd year Ph.D. student in the [Informatics Department](https://www.informatics.illinois.edu/) at [University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://www.illinois.edu/), advised by Dr. [Cynthia D'Angelo](https://cynthiadangelo.com). 

* My research focuses on studying collaborative learning in the classroom. I'm also broadly interested in the areas of Human-Computer Interaction & Accessibility. I’m currently working measuring group collaboration by analyzing speech data. I am also interested in ways to automate assessing group collaboration using classroom audio.

* I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Psychology & Information Systems from [California State University Dominguez Hills](http://csudh.edu./)]. My undergraduate research advisors were Dr.[Thomas Normaan](https://www.csudh.edu/cbapp/contact-us/faculty/thomasnorman), Dr. [Mark Carrier](https://www.drmarkcarrier.com/publications)
