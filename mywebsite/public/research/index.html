      <p><strong>HomeSHARE: Designing Data Visualizations for Older Adults</strong>
<img src="/./research_files/prohealth_reu.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>ProHealth REU Researchers Hanifa Hotelwala and Eugene Cox at Indiana University are developing data visualizations for older adults designed to help older adults age-in-place.
The project “Home Share” is an NSF-funded geographically distributed testbed to allow researchers to investigate and evaluate pervasive technologies inside of homes designed to allow older adults to age-in-place.Researchers conducted Co-design sessions with older adults to better understand their needs.Over the course of 10 weeks Hanifa and Eugene Recruited older adults for their Co-Design session, where older adults were given a Garmin ForeRunner 35 smart watch, and installed the Garmin Connect application on their mobile devices. Researchers then ran a co-design session (n=6) to gain insights into data visualizations that older adults would find insightful. After analyzing the co-design session researchers iterated on a prototype encompassing all the features that were mentioned previously.</p>
<p><strong>Teachback: Closing the loop in Computer Agent/ Patient Communication about Self Care</strong></p>
<p><img src="/./research_files/9rVoPJ.jpg" alt=""></p>
<p>While patient-centered communication supports patient self-care, healthcare providers rarely have enough time to consistently use this communication. Technology has potential to support patient-centered communication by delivering provider communication, but frequently older adults prefer direct communication with providers. Conversational agents (CAs) may support provider communication with older adults by emulating best practices from face-to-face communication. In this project, We investigated older adults’(n=36) response to a prototype CA communication system that served as a virtual provider and presented medication instructions using teachback, a recommended best practice that involves asking patients questions to ‘close the communication loop’. We found that older adults were open to interacting with the CA and thought it would help support self-care. They thought the CA was a more effective teacher when using teachback and that this interactive strategy helped them remember the instructions.</p>
